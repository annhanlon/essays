##Codex Tulane or Códice Hamelulpan

The Codex Tulane or Códice Hamelulpan provides a fascinating example of the adaptability and re-purposing of native texts within changing historical contexts.  Like most post-contact codices, the Codex Tulane was likely composed in the early decades of Spanish rule (ca. 1550s) to establish an authoritative lineage or lineages vying for territorial rights and privileges.  Painted on gessoed pieces of deer hide are 15 generations of royal ancestors spanning 300 years of marital history from two Mixtec-speaking towns, Acatlán and Chila, located in what is today southern Puebla and northern Oaxaca, Mexico.  The document was painted for Mixtec elites to support their claims before Spanish colonial administrators who likely would not have understood the Mixtec glyphs or the rolled out format but would have respected its native provenance and visual impressiveness.  This alone would have conferred on the document a kind of discursive authority which local caciques deployed in their favor. The physical characteristics and textual content of the piece combine pre-contact pictorial conventions of both Mixtec and Aztec indigenous scribes, such as the deerskin substrate and the use of the native calendar, hieroglyphics, and iconography.  Notable too is the continued indigenous practice of beginning the manuscript with references to the creation of the world, iconic places, and principal deities, thereby extending the reign of these two noble houses back into the mythological past and connecting them to the political history of the region.

#San Juan Ñumí

These images are part of a mid-sixteenth century Mesoamerican painted manuscript on deer hide presented as a map in land litigation in 1802. The codex begins with Mixtec text naming the boundaries of ==San Juan Ñumí=={1983,3185,666,520}, a town in northern Oaxaca. The rest of the codex is pictorial and reads from top to bottom. A mythological origin scene is followed by the genealogies of two ruling dynasties from the polities of Acatlán and likely Chila in the Mixtec-speaking region of southern Puebla. The manuscript is also known as Codex Huamelulpan.

#Tira de Santa Catarina Ixtepeji

This manuscript map, known as the Tira de Santa Catarina Ixtepeji and housed at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Library's American Geographical Society Library, is hand-painted and recounts part of the history of Santa Catarina Ixtepeji, in the Ixtlán District in the Sierra Norte region of Oaxaca in southwestern Mexico. The scroll tells the history of leadership and land ownership, and is believed to have been written in both the local Zapotec and Spanish languages. Its purpose was to regularize land titles and ownership in the eyes of the bureaucracy of the Spanish Empire. There are two dates (1691 and 1709 A.D.) inscribed on it that are believed to be the dates it was used as a visual aid in making a presentation to Imperial officials. Similar to the Tulane Codex, this is also post-contact but nearly a century older.
