.ve-header "DH Workshop 2023: Maps, IIIF, Juncture"

This workshop will walk you through the steps to set up a Juncture/GitHub account and create a simple digital visual essay. You can do a lot with Juncture, but it's also a great jumping-off point to dip your toe into the GitHub, IIIF, geographic location, and Wikidata waters, if you want it to be.
