In its day, Milwaukee’s ==Polish-American=={Q1189552} community was among the largest in the United States. The first Polish inhabitant of Milwaukee arrived as early as 1842, and by the turn of the century Polish-Americans formed the second largest ethnic group in the city. 

Most settled in four-square mile area on the South Side known as “Polonia.” This digital collection draws from the work of studio photographer Roman Kwasniewski to illustrate the history of Milwaukee Polonia from the early 1900s through the 1940s. The archive consists of over 32,000 images.


## Roman Kwasniewski

Roman B.J. Kwasniewski was born June 10, 1886 in Chicago, Illinois to Jozef and Wanda (Dyniewicz) Kwasniewski. The family moved to Milwaukee in the 1890s. Roman was educated at Milwaukee public schools until he was ten years old. He attended St. Hyacinth’s parochial school (1898-1900), South Division High School (1900-1904), and Marquette University (1926-1928). In 1913, he opened Park Studio at 1024 West Lincoln Avenue; he closed the business in the mid-1940s. Kwasniewski married Mary Drozniakiewicz, and the couple had three children: Edward, Adele, and Roman. Roman B.J. Kwasniewski passed away in May 1980.

## The Lincoln Avenue Studio

From his studio on Lincoln Avenue, Roman Kwasniewski captured important events in the lives of thousands of Polish-Americans: First Communions, Confirmations, graduations, weddings, and anniversaries. He was widely regarded as his community’s premiere photographer. In addition to his commercial portrait work, Kwasniewski took thousands of pictures of the community in which he lived. His photos show Milwaukee’s Polish-American community during its most cohesive period. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries acquired the physical collection in February 1979 with the assistance of Polanki, the Polish Women’s Club of Milwaukee, and Kwasniewski’s daughter, Adele, and her husband, John Kaczmarowski. It includes over 29,000 negatives, 6,000 prints, as well as lantern slides, photographic postcards, and business documents. It was opened for research in May 1991.
