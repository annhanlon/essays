The Atlas Novus Coelestis is a 1742 volume held in our American Geographical Society Library. The image is from our Digital Collections, and uses the IIIF manifest to make it available on this page. 

You can use the IIIF properties to zoom into specific areas of an image - here using the "static" call.
