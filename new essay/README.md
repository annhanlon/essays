A demonstration site to illustrate how to use our collections and the Juncture tool to create visual essays. 

##Using the Zoom in IIIF to interact with an image

The Atlas Novus Coelestis is a 1742 volume held in our American Geographical Society Library. The image is from our Digital Collections, and uses the IIIF manifest to make it available on this page. You can use the text below to zoom to different parts of the image. 
- ==an area in the middle of the map=={1655,1608,667,580}
- ==the Leo constellation=={1216,331,1334,1159}

To find the coordinates for the area you want to feature, zoom into the full image after you've loaded it into Juncture and then look for the four coordinates in the lower right of the image frame. 

##Comparing images
You can compare two images in the essay.
